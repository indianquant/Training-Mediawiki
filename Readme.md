This README explains how to get started with the MediaWiki Campus training proramme. 

## What is about this programme? 🤔

This is a initiative to aware people about Wikimedia and MediaWiki in general. Though this is open for everyone. college students aspiring for programmes like GSoC and Outreachy are under focus currently. People learn better when they can learn with a community of likeminded peers. This programme helps the students get started with MediaWiki, with training and support from past GSoC students. Once you complete the training, you will be able to contribute to MediaWiki and submit patches and solve bugs in it .

## How do I participate? 🙋🏽‍

You must complete the following stages:

1.  Complete the training exercises 👨🏿‍🏫 posted here.
2.  Submit your solutions to the exercises 📝.


## Completing the training

To complete the training, you must complete all  training modules.

Once you complete all of the exercises, you can submit them. A reviewer will then review your submission. They may have feedback that will require you to make some changes to your submission, so make sure you check back on GitHub every now and then! 

## How does this training work? What are the expectations of a participant?

During the training, you will define and set goals for yourselves. As a pariticipant, I expect you to meet these goals, and get the most out of this training. I also understand that you are busy students, trying to manage academics and personal interest. This is why you set your own goals during the training, and can complete the training at your own pace.


## Do I need to know how to use Git/GitHub?

Since you are aspiring for GSoC and Outreachy and this is why you are here :), some Git/GitHub knowledge is helpful. You can learn everything you need to complete the training [here](https://lab.github.com). During the training, you will also cover an introduction to Git on the command line.
